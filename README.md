# foodspots

The foodspotsapp is a collection of food spots, that have been reviewed by others or by yourself.
You are able to add new food spots yourself or comment on the ones, that have been reviewed by
others already.
By default, a home screen exists, and you can also look at the top-rated food spots or just any food
spots based on filters.
(if you login, then you will be able to look at your own reviewed food spots as well)
